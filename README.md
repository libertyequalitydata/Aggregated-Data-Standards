# Data-Standard
To build an open standard for all the worlds data. 

In order to bring user held data models to the world, we need to ensure data models follow commonly accepted principles, widely used customs as well as  universality to be meaningful. This project tracks the building of a global taxonomy, using benchmarks such as IAB Techlabs open standard content taxonomy and CINTs open standard taxonomy. 

The open standard will be public, developer centric and widely adoptable. 

Monumental task, one step at a time, input and suggestions welcome.
