# Aggregated-Data-Standards

In order to bring user held data models to the world, we need to ensure data models follow commonly accepted principles, widely used customs as well as  universality to be meaningful. This project tracks the development and collaboration around different aggregate data models built on top of user-held data. 

References to ensure broad interoperability include resources such as IAB Techlabs open standard content taxonomy and CINTs open standard taxonomy. 

If you are working on a use case on user held data and would like to collaborate on your data aggregates or models, get in touch with us at on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/libertyequalitydata/shared_invite/zt-ddr4t974-MCzsch4FSeux8DrFQ2atbQ">Liberty Equality Data Slack</a> and get access to our data model.
